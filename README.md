# Project Euler: Problem 2 - Even Fibonnaci numbers:

---

## First thoughts:
We wish to add up all the even numbers that occur in the Fibonacci sequence from 1 to 4 million. Off the bat, I'm thinking structure-wise, what would be the best approach?<br>
I'm thinking of at least two functions (in addition to main):
1. One to calculate what the next number in the Fibonnaci sequence of numbers will be, and 
2. An isEven() function to determine (by % 2 == 0) whether that number is even.
<br>

This is likely the non-algorithmic solution to this problem, but then again, these are my first thoughts.
<br><br>
I will try this approach first, and update this README with any updates as I move forward.
